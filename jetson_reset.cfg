# GPIO Pin Reference for Raspberry Pi:
# Available GPIO pins: 2, 3, 4, 17, 27, 22, 10, 9, 11, 5, 6, 13, 19, 26, 18, 20, 21, 16, 12, 25, 24, 23, 8, 7
# Default pins used: 18, 19, 20, 21, 26
# 
# Circuit for each Jetson:
# RPi GPIO → 1KΩ resistor → NPN transistor base
# Transistor collector → Jetson reset pin
# Transistor emitter → Ground (shared with Jetson)
# 
# When GPIO goes HIGH, transistor conducts and pulls reset pin LOW
